# 🪟 Picaso

Picaso is an image gallery app which fetches the images from the Unsplash API. I built this side project for learning
purpose and to also help the beginners on their coding journey. I have used latest technologies for this project.

## 📦 Technologies

- `Vite`
- `React.js`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `Unsplash API`

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started this project because I wanted to learn more about React V18 and React router V6. Initially I thought of using
the NextJS because that is what now recommended by React documentation.
But still many people use the setup react boilerplate so decided to use that for this project. Moving forward I will
only use NextJS. I did setup this project using the Vite boilerplate.
I have installed TailwindCSS because I love using that and resonates with my development workflow.

I wanted to create the masonry grid for image gallery so I used a plugin for that.
Initially I used BrowserRouter but discovered that Github pages does not allow that so switched to HashRouter just for
deployment purposes.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of React router v6 and React.
Used TailwindCSS for styling the elements.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Use different Unsplash APIs to create a collection of pictures.

## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Generate an API key from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and put over there.
3. Run `yarn install` or `npm i` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `yarn dev` or `npm dev` to get the project started.
5. Open [http://localhost:5173/picaso/#/gallery/mountains](http://localhost:5173/picaso/#/gallery/mountains) in your web
   browser to view the app.
